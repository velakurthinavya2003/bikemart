                Heavy-hearted purchase as I didn't have so big budget but 
                at the last moment due to some good god my brother changed.
                Heavy great feel to ride still enjoying the riding wings
                The comfortable look feels great still every time now great 
                performance every time after every service it feels the same as new
                Services and maintenance are sometimes a little heavy on my pocket
                Pros are good bikes for a small family
                A lot pros to say etc
